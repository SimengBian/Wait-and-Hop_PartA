Follow these steps to run the project：
1.Run topology.py to configure the topology and save all the information as npz file.(number.npz and matrices.npz)
2.Run probSetup.py to construct projMat and TMvec matrices and save them to p_matrices.npz .
3.Run main.py to get the result data and picture(.eps).Note the opt_time can be less then 0（-1）,1,5,and 10.
